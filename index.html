    <p>
        <b><em>KochChart version 4.0.4 has added "Auto-Update".</em></b> Now you can leave your Koch chart, your Altitude chart
        and your Carburetor Ice Potential chart open, and the graphics (along with the Koch tab) will be auto-updated at an
        interval of your choosing (provided a valid station METAR can be retrieved).

    <p>
        <b><em>KochChart version 4.0.3</em></b> has added a chart indicating the potential for carburetor icing. This chart
        is based on the carburetor icing probability
        <a href="https://www.casa.gov.au/sites/default/files/2022-10/carburettor-icing-probability-chart.pdf">chart</a>
        published by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) of Australia.
        <center> <img src="images/carb_ice.JPG" style="width: 400px;" /> </center>
        How does this chart differ from the "new" U.S. NTSB
        <a href="https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket/Document/docBLOB?ID=40440999&FileExtension=.PDF&FileName=Carburetor%20Icing%20Chart-Master.PDF">chart</a>?
        Not a bit. Well, they used different colors, but it appears they adopted the CASA chart. The FAA also has a couple of
        versions of carburetor icing charts. One is in their "Winter Flying Tips"
        <a href="https://www.faasafety.gov/files/events/GL/GL09/2018/GL0985130/P-8740-24.pdf">pub</a> and the other is in
        the Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB)
        <a href="https://drs.faa.gov/browse/excelExternalWindow/F319315CFC90C3F7862575E500439FA0.0001?modalOpened=true">CE-09-35</a>.
        These charts, when the axes are converted to those of the CASA and NTSB charts, are seen to be different,
        but not drastically so. The trends are the same. See the comparison below. Click on any chart to enlarge it.

        <b><em>KochChart version 4 has been released!</em></b> The new version allows the

        can then be sent to your email-enabled device.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome! This site is your source for the KochChart educational software
        tool. This tool compares various estimating methods (including,
        but not limited to, the Koch Chart) for assessing the impact of
        density altitude on take-off and rate-of-climb performance. In
        addition, the tool can estimate the effects of wind, runway slope
        and runway surface on take-off distance.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is a free educational tool created
        to raise awareness about the significant effects density altitude
        has on aircraft performance. These effects are especially important for pilots flying
        at high-elevation airports.
    </p>

    <p>
        Why the name 'KochChart'? This program started as a relatively simple digital version
        of the venerable Koch Chart nomograph (the roots of which are somewhat obscure).
        The user would type in key parameters (air temperature and pressure altitude) to produce the chart.
        But eventually automated METAR collection, others' estimating methods (besides Koch), tables,
        comparison graphs, and even carburetor ice potential were included.
    </p>

    <p>
        The algorithms for density altitude effects used in this software were originally developed for
        light, single-engine, normally aspirated (i.e., not-turbocharged) piston aircraft.
        They are not applicable to other types of aircraft.

    <h2>Downloads</h2>
    <p>
        You can download the KochChart software at this
        <a href="https://github.com/MtnFlyer83/AppBinaries/releases">page</a>.
        Look for the release with<img src="images/latest.JPG" alt="Latest badge" style="vertical-align: middle;" />after the release name.
    </p>

    <p>
        Currently, the software is only available for Windows.
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
        You can view an instructional video here:<br />

    </p>
    <p>
        And the software was also featured in a Colorado Pilot's Association webinar, which included a detailed demonstration of the software. It
        can be viewed here (the software discussion starts at around the 32-minute point in the video):<br />
