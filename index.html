    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome! This site is your source for the KochChart educational software
        tool. This tool compares various estimating methods (including,
        but not limited to, the Koch Chart) for assessing the impact of
        density altitude on take-off and rate-of-climb performance. In
        addition, the tool can estimate the effects of wind, runway slope
        and runway surface on take-off distance.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is a free educational tool created
        to raise awareness about the significant effect density altitude
        has on aircraft performance, and is especially important for pilots flying
        at high-elevation airports.
    </p>

    <p>
        Why the name 'Koch Chart'? This program started as a relatively simple digital version
        of the venerable Koch Chart nomograph (the roots of which are somewhat obscure).
        The user would type in key parameters to produce the chart.
        But eventually automated METAR collection and
        others' estimating methods were included. Now the program does much more than produce
        a Koch Chart, but the name lives on!
    </p>

    <p>
        The algorithms used in the software were originally developed for
        light, single-engine, normally aspirated (i.e., not-turbocharged) piston aircraft.
        They are not applicable to other types of aircraft.

    <h2>Downloads</h2>
    <p>
        You can download the KochChart software at this
        <a href="https://github.com/MtnFlyer83/AppBinaries/releases">page</a>.
        Look for the release with<img src="latest.JPG" alt="Latest badge" style="vertical-align: middle;" />after the release name.
    </p>

    <p>
        Currently, the software is only available for Windows.
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
        You can view an instructional video here:<br />

    </p>
    <p>
        And the software was also featured in a Colorado Pilot's Association webinar, which included a detailed demonstration of the software. It
        can be viewed here (the software discussion starts at around the 32-minute point in the video):<br />
